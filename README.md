### What is data science？

Data science is a discipline that uses data to learn knowledge, and its goal is to produce data products by extracting valuable parts from data [1]. It combines theory and techniques from many fields, including applied mathematics, statistics, pattern recognition, machine learning, data visualization, data warehousing, and high-performance computing.

Data science includes but is not limited to:


- Algorithm development
- Machine Learning
- artificial intelligence
- Predictive analytics
- Big data application
- Natural language processing
- Mathematics, Statistics


### What is the difference between data analysis and data science？


「 **DA** 」
The focus is on describing and visualizing the information contained in the data, and then conveying and explaining it further to non-technical users. A data analyst who does predictive analytics has a lot of overlap with the job of a data scientist—more similar to a data scientist, but not through an automated, algorithmic approach to outputting predictions.


- Tools: Excel (Vlookup | VBA) | Python
- Database: SQL (Oracle | MySQL | PostgreSQL)
- Visualization: Tableau | Power BI | FineReport

「 **DS** 」
A multidisciplinary field focused on finding actionable insights from large volumes of raw and structured data. The field focuses primarily on uncovering answers to things we don't realize we don't yet know. Data science experts use several different techniques to obtain answers, including computer science, predictive analytics, statistics, and machine learning, parsing through massive data sets in an effort to provide solutions to problems that have not yet been recognized.


- Tools: Python | R | Excel
- Database: SQL (Oracle | MySQL | PostgreSQL)
- Mathematics: Algebra | Probability | Statistics
- Algorithms: Machine Learning | Deep Learning
- Big Data: Hadoop | Spark | Hive

### Five Questions for yourself


```
Do you have an immersive data analysis learning atmosphere?

Can you complete the project by yourself in a month?

Can you understand the online code, dig out all the knowledge points, and make mistakes?

Can you learn to build your own data analysis and modeling system?

Can you fully describe the entire project end-to-end with the interviewer and catch all the interviewer's questions?
